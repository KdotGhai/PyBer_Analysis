# PyBer_Analysis

### Overview:<br />
 <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this module, we’ve been creating visualizations on ride-sharing data for a company called “Pyber” after inspecting, cleaning, ,merging, and formatting the data provided. We’re to create easy and digestible Data-Frames and charts to show the correlation between city type, total  number of drivers & riders, and total fares. In doing so the company aims to make better decisions as they move forward with their business, employees, and customers. However, we’ve been tasked to go further in-depth by creating a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type(we’ll be making the data-frame alongside with it as well). From there, we’ll be able to infer noticeable trends in which the company may need to act upon.<br />
